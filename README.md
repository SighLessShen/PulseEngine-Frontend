# ccdcscoring-frontend
Frontend react application to facilitate access to scores.

This web application handles all frontend interactions with the backend for the web application portion of the scoring model. It enables users to view competition scores and it also is where competition administrators can easily create and access information about their competition.

The application was built ontop of react and the core UI framework used was chakra-ui. An important aspect of this project was to learn how react hooks work and that is why all components in the application are built using hooks and functional components.
